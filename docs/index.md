# tanka provider



This is an unofficial [Tanka](https://github.com/grafana/tanka) provider for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

This provider allows you to install and manage Tanka ressources in a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform.

The provider needs to be configured with the cluster API server endpoint, the CA certificate and a token for the user entry.

When configured, the provider will update the kubeconfig on the running system with these credentials. Tanka looks in this file for credentials when given just the endpoint.

*Note:* The kubeconfig is not cleaned up after operation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "tanka" {
  endpoint               = var.endpoint
  cluster_ca_certificate = var.cluster_ca_certificate
  token                  = var.token
}
```
